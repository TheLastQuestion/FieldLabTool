# FieldLabTool
The Field Lab Tool is really a suite of methods that city government employees use to make decisions in a more collaborative, data-driven way. Various agencies contribute data to a single platform which generates the score-card, dashboard, and pattern analysis output that officials use to review progress. The data also drives an early-warning system and visualization interface that help city task forces prioritize actions and direct resources most effectively.
